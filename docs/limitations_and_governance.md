\# Limitations \& Governance



\## Limitations

\- Synthetic or sample inputs may not reflect real enterprise variability.

\- Rule-based detections can produce false positives without environment context.

\- Control mappings indicate governance relevance, not definitive compliance posture.



\## Governance Principles

\- Human-in-the-loop: analysts validate before action.

\- Auditability: outputs are saved as artifacts (CSV/JSON/MD).

\- Transparency: detections are explainable and traceable to rules and mappings.



\## Recommended Operating Guardrails

\- Treat "Critical/High" as prioritization, not certainty.

\- Confirm events against raw telemetry before declaring an incident.

\- Maintain version control for detection logic and control mappings.
