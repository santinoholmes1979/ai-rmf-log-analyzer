POAM-001,2026-02-08,Medium,AUTH-001 - Failed login burst (possible password guessing),"AC-7, IA-2, AU-6","Repeated authentication failures may indicate credential guessing, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access if controls (e.g., lockout/MFA) are ineffective.","Validate whether the source IP is expected (VPN, admin subnet, known jump box). | Check for additional failed logins for the same user across other hosts. | If suspicious: reset credentials, review MFA status, and block IP if appropriate. | Confirm AC-7 lockout policy and alert thresholds are enforced.",Open,Supports monitoring of authentication anomalies and audit review.
POAM-002,2026-02-08,High,ACCT-001 - New user account created,"AC-2, IA-2, AU-6","Unauthorized account creation can enable persistence and unauthorized access, undermining account management controls and auditability.",Confirm account creation authorization (ticket/change record). | Review who initiated creation and from what host. | Check whether the account has been used for interactive logons. | Ensure account provisioning follows AC-2 approval workflow.,Open,Account creation must be authorized and auditable.
POAM-003,2026-02-08,High,PRIV-001 - User added to Administrators group,"AC-2, AC-6, AU-6","Unapproved elevation to administrative privileges can enable lateral movement and system compromise, violating least privilege expectations.","Confirm the group membership change is authorized and documented. | Identify the actor who made the change and the originating system. | Review recent activity for the newly-privileged account (logons, processes). | Verify least privilege and remove membership if not required.",Open,Privilege escalation should follow least privilege principles.
POAM-004,2026-02-08,Critical,AUD-001 - Audit log cleared,"AU-9, AU-6, IR-4","Clearing audit logs reduces visibility and may indicate anti-forensic activity, impairing detection, response, and accountability.","Treat as potential incident: preserve evidence and notify incident response. | Determine which account cleared logs and why; validate authorization. | Check for gaps in audit coverage and whether forwarding/central logging exists. | Verify AU-9 protections (access controls, forwarding, write-once storage).",Open,Audit integrity loss may indicate anti-forensics activity.
POAM-005,2026-02-08,High,PROC-001 - Encoded PowerShell execution detected,"SI-4, AU-6, IR-4","Obfuscated PowerShell execution may indicate malicious command execution and can facilitate defense evasion, persistence, or payload delivery.",Decode and review the PowerShell command if possible; look for persistence or payload download. | Correlate process creation with network connections and file writes. | Verify whether script execution policy controls are enforced. | If suspicious: isolate host and initiate incident handling procedures.,Open,Obfuscated command execution may indicate malicious activity.
